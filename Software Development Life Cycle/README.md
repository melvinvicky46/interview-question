**What is Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)?**
```
SDLC is a process followed for software building within a software organization. SDLC consists of a precise plan that describes how to develop, maintain, replace, and enhance specific software. The life cycle defines a method for improving the quality of software and the all-around development process.  

The main phases of SDLC include Requirements, Design, Implementation (Coding), Testing, Deployment, and Maintenance. These phases represent the stages a software project goes through from initiation to completion.

**What is the need for SDLC?**
```
SDLC is a method, approach, or process that is followed by a software development organization while developing any software. SDLC models were introduced to follow a disciplined and systematic method while designing software. With the software development life cycle, the process of software design is divided into small parts, which makes the problem more understandable and easier to solve. SDLC comprises a detailed description or step-by-step plan for designing, developing, testing, and maintaining the software.

**Stages of the Software Development Life Cycle**
```
SDLC specifies the task(s) to be performed at various stages by a software engineer or developer. It ensures that the end product is able to meet the customer’s expectations and fits within the overall budget. Hence, it’s vital for a software developer to have prior knowledge of this software development process. 

The SDLC model involves six phases or stages while developing any software. SDLC is a collection of these six stages, and the stages of SDLC are as follows(PDDDTD):

Planning and Requirement Analysis:
- Planning
- Define Project Scope
- Set Objective and goals
- Resource planning

Defining Requirements:
- Defining
- funtional requirement
- Technical requirement
- Requirement review

Designing Architecture:
- Design
- Low Level Design
- High Level Design

Developing Product:
- Development
- Coding Standard
- Scalable code
- Version Control
- Code review

Product Testing and Integration:
- System testing
- Manual Testing
- Automation Testing

Deployment and Maintenance of Products:
- Deployment and Maintenance
- Release Planning
- Deployment 
- Maintaince 
- Feedback

**Software Development Life Cycle Models**
```
Waterfall Model: 
It is the fundamental model of the software development life cycle. This is a very simple model. The waterfall model is not in practice anymore, but it is the basis for all other SDLC models. Because of its simple structure, the waterfall model is easier to use and provides a tangible output. In the waterfall model, once a phase seems to be completed, it cannot be changed, and due to this less flexible nature, the waterfall model is not in practice anymore. 

Agile Model:
The agile model in SDLC was mainly designed to adapt to changing requests quickly. The main goal of the Agile model is to facilitate quick project completion. The agile model refers to a group of development processes. These processes have some similar characteristics but also possess certain subtle differences among themselves.

Spiral Model:
The spiral model in SDLC is one of the most crucial SDLC models that provides support for risk handling. It has various spirals in its diagrammatic representation; the number of spirals depends upon the type of project. Each loop in the spiral structure indicates the Phases of the Spiral model.  

V-Shaped Model:
The V-shaped model in SDLC is executed in a sequential manner in V-shape. Each stage or phase of this model is integrated with a testing phase. After every development phase, a testing phase is associated with it, and the next phase will start once the previous phase is completed, i.e., development & testing. It is also known as the verification or validation model.

Agile Software Development Methodology in software development is an efficient methodology that helps teams produce high-quality software quickly and with flexibility.

Agile Software Development Steps:
- Requirement Gathering
- Planning
- Development
- Testing
- Deployment
- Maintainance
