React Query is a library that simplifies the process of fetching, caching, synchronizing, and updating server state in React applications. It helps you manage server-side data with ease, improving the efficiency and responsiveness of your applications. Here’s a comprehensive overview of its core concepts, features, and how to use it effectively:

### Core Concepts

1. **Queries**: Used to fetch and cache data. Queries can automatically refetch data when needed, manage loading states, and handle errors.

2. **Mutations**: Used to create, update, or delete data. Mutations handle side-effects and can trigger re-fetching of related queries to keep data in sync.

3. **Cache**: React Query caches the results of queries to avoid redundant network requests and improve performance. It supports stale data management, background updates, and cache invalidation.

4. **Query Keys**: Unique identifiers for queries. They help React Query manage and differentiate between different data-fetching requests.

5. **Devtools**: React Query provides a set of devtools for inspecting and debugging queries and mutations.

### Key Features

1. **Automatic Refetching**:
   - Queries can be set to refetch data automatically at specified intervals or on certain events (e.g., when the window regains focus).

2. **Pagination and Infinite Queries**:
   - Handle paginated and infinite data with built-in support, making it easier to work with large datasets.

3. **Query Invalidation and Refetching**:
   - Invalidate and refetch queries to keep data up-to-date after mutations or changes in application state.

4. **Background Fetching**:
   - Data can be fetched in the background to keep the UI responsive and up-to-date.

5. **Query Cancellation**:
   - Supports cancelling in-flight requests when they are no longer needed, helping to avoid unnecessary network traffic and processing.

### Basic Usage

1. **Installation**:

   ```bash
   npm install @tanstack/react-query
   ```

2. **Set Up QueryClient**:

   Wrap your application with `QueryClientProvider` to provide React Query’s client to your app.

   ```jsx
   import React from 'react';
   import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
   import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from '@tanstack/react-query';
   import App from './App';

   const queryClient = new QueryClient();

   ReactDOM.render(
     <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
       <App />
     </QueryClientProvider>,
     document.getElementById('root')
   );
   ```

3. **Fetching Data with `useQuery`**:

   Use the `useQuery` hook to fetch data. React Query will handle caching, loading states, and error handling.

   ```jsx
   import React from 'react';
   import { useQuery } from '@tanstack/react-query';

   const fetchTodos = async () => {
     const response = await fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos');
     if (!response.ok) throw new Error('Network response was not ok');
     return response.json();
   };

   function Todos() {
     const { data, error, isLoading } = useQuery(['todos'], fetchTodos);

     if (isLoading) return <div>Loading...</div>;
     if (error) return <div>Error: {error.message}</div>;

     return (
       <ul>
         {data.map(todo => (
           <li key={todo.id}>{todo.title}</li>
         ))}
       </ul>
     );
   }

   export default Todos;
   ```

4. **Mutating Data with `useMutation`**:

   Use the `useMutation` hook to create, update, or delete data, and manage side effects.

   ```jsx
   import React from 'react';
   import { useMutation, useQueryClient } from '@tanstack/react-query';

   const addTodo = async (newTodo) => {
     const response = await fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos', {
       method: 'POST',
       headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
       body: JSON.stringify(newTodo),
     });
     if (!response.ok) throw new Error('Network response was not ok');
     return response.json();
   };

   function AddTodo() {
     const queryClient = useQueryClient();
     const mutation = useMutation(addTodo, {
       onSuccess: () => {
         queryClient.invalidateQueries(['todos']);
       },
     });

     const handleAdd = () => {
       mutation.mutate({ title: 'New Todo', completed: false });
     };

     return (
       <div>
         <button onClick={handleAdd}>Add Todo</button>
         {mutation.isLoading && <p>Adding...</p>}
         {mutation.isError && <p>Error: {mutation.error.message}</p>}
         {mutation.isSuccess && <p>Todo added!</p>}
       </div>
     );
   }

   export default AddTodo;
   ```

### Advanced Topics

- **Custom Query Functions**: Define custom query functions to handle complex data-fetching logic.
- **Query Keys**: Use arrays or objects to pass multiple parameters to queries, allowing for more dynamic data fetching.
- **Optimistic Updates**: Implement optimistic UI updates to provide a better user experience during mutations.
- **Pagination and Infinite Queries**: Leverage `useInfiniteQuery` for handling paginated or infinite data fetching.

React Query can greatly simplify data management in your React applications, making it easier to work with server state and providing tools for efficient data fetching, caching, and synchronization. If you have specific questions or need examples of advanced features, feel free to ask!


Absolutely! Here’s a deeper dive into some more advanced features and best practices for using React Query effectively.

### Advanced Features

#### 1. **Query Keys**

Query keys are crucial for React Query’s ability to manage and cache data. They uniquely identify queries and can be complex arrays or objects to represent multiple parameters.

**Example: Dynamic Query Keys**

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { useQuery } from '@tanstack/react-query';

const fetchTodoById = async (id) => {
  const response = await fetch(`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/${id}`);
  if (!response.ok) throw new Error('Network response was not ok');
  return response.json();
};

function TodoDetail({ id }) {
  const { data, error, isLoading } = useQuery(['todo', id], () => fetchTodoById(id), {
    enabled: !!id, // Only fetch if id is truthy
  });

  if (isLoading) return <div>Loading...</div>;
  if (error) return <div>Error: {error.message}</div>;

  return <div>{data.title}</div>;
}
```

#### 2. **Pagination and Infinite Queries**

For handling paginated or infinite data, React Query provides hooks like `useInfiniteQuery` and utilities for managing pages.

**Example: Infinite Query**

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { useInfiniteQuery } from '@tanstack/react-query';

const fetchTodos = async ({ pageParam = 1 }) => {
  const response = await fetch(`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos?_page=${pageParam}&_limit=10`);
  if (!response.ok) throw new Error('Network response was not ok');
  return response.json();
};

function Todos() {
  const {
    data,
    error,
    isLoading,
    fetchNextPage,
    hasNextPage,
    isFetchingNextPage,
  } = useInfiniteQuery(
    ['todos'],
    fetchTodos,
    {
      getNextPageParam: (lastPage, pages) => {
        // Assuming the API provides total count and we have the current page
        const totalCount = 200; // Example total count
        const totalPages = Math.ceil(totalCount / 10);
        if (pages.length < totalPages) {
          return pages.length + 1;
        }
        return undefined; // No more pages
      },
    }
  );

  if (isLoading) return <div>Loading...</div>;
  if (error) return <div>Error: {error.message}</div>;

  return (
    <div>
      <ul>
        {data.pages.flat().map(todo => (
          <li key={todo.id}>{todo.title}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
      <button
        onClick={() => fetchNextPage()}
        disabled={isFetchingNextPage || !hasNextPage}
      >
        {isFetchingNextPage ? 'Loading more...' : hasNextPage ? 'Load More' : 'No More'}
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### 3. **Optimistic Updates**

Optimistic updates improve user experience by updating the UI before the server responds. This is particularly useful for actions like adding or deleting items.

**Example: Optimistic Update**

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { useMutation, useQueryClient } from '@tanstack/react-query';

const addTodo = async (newTodo) => {
  const response = await fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify(newTodo),
  });
  if (!response.ok) throw new Error('Network response was not ok');
  return response.json();
};

function AddTodo() {
  const queryClient = useQueryClient();
  const mutation = useMutation(addTodo, {
    // Optimistic update
    onMutate: async (newTodo) => {
      await queryClient.cancelQueries(['todos']);
      const previousTodos = queryClient.getQueryData(['todos']);
      queryClient.setQueryData(['todos'], old => [...old, newTodo]);
      return { previousTodos };
    },
    onError: (err, newTodo, context) => {
      queryClient.setQueryData(['todos'], context.previousTodos);
    },
    onSuccess: () => {
      queryClient.invalidateQueries(['todos']);
    },
  });

  const handleAdd = () => {
    mutation.mutate({ title: 'New Todo', completed: false });
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={handleAdd}>Add Todo</button>
      {mutation.isLoading && <p>Adding...</p>}
      {mutation.isError && <p>Error: {mutation.error.message}</p>}
      {mutation.isSuccess && <p>Todo added!</p>}
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### 4. **Background Fetching and Stale Time**

Control how often data is refetched with `staleTime` and `refetchInterval` options.

**Example: Stale Time and Refetch Interval**

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { useQuery } from '@tanstack/react-query';

const fetchTodos = async () => {
  const response = await fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos');
  if (!response.ok) throw new Error('Network response was not ok');
  return response.json();
};

function Todos() {
  const { data, error, isLoading } = useQuery(
    ['todos'],
    fetchTodos,
    {
      staleTime: 60000, // Data is fresh for 1 minute
      refetchInterval: 30000, // Refetch data every 30 seconds
    }
  );

  if (isLoading) return <div>Loading...</div>;
  if (error) return <div>Error: {error.message}</div>;

  return (
    <ul>
      {data.map(todo => (
        <li key={todo.id}>{todo.title}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

### Best Practices

1. **Use Query Keys Wisely**:
   - Use unique query keys to avoid clashes and ensure data integrity. For dynamic queries, use arrays or objects to represent different states or parameters.

2. **Handle Errors Gracefully**:
   - Always provide error handling in your queries and mutations. This helps maintain a good user experience and makes debugging easier.

3. **Leverage Devtools**:
   - Use React Query Devtools to inspect and debug your queries and mutations. It can help you understand the state of your queries and optimize performance.

4. **Avoid Over-fetching**:
   - Use `staleTime` and `cacheTime` settings appropriately to avoid unnecessary network requests. Only refetch data when it’s actually needed.

5. **Manage Side Effects**:
   - Be mindful of side effects and cleanup in your queries and mutations, especially with component unmounting and error handling.

6. **Optimize Performance**:
   - Use pagination and infinite queries to manage large datasets efficiently. Optimize your queries to fetch only the data you need.

By understanding and utilizing these advanced features and best practices, you can fully leverage React Query to manage server state effectively in your React applications. If you have specific scenarios or additional questions, feel free to ask!


Sure! Here are some common and advanced interview questions on React Query, along with brief explanations for each. These questions cover various aspects of React Query, including basic usage, advanced features, and best practices.

### Basic Questions

1. **What is React Query, and why would you use it?**
   - **Answer:** React Query is a library for managing server state in React applications. It simplifies data fetching, caching, synchronization, and updating of server state, which improves the performance and responsiveness of applications.

2. **How do you install React Query in a React project?**
   - **Answer:** You can install React Query using npm or yarn:
     ```bash
     npm install @tanstack/react-query
     # or
     yarn add @tanstack/react-query
     ```

3. **How do you set up React Query in your application?**
   - **Answer:** You need to wrap your application with `QueryClientProvider` and provide it with a `QueryClient` instance:
     ```jsx
     import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from '@tanstack/react-query';

     const queryClient = new QueryClient();

     function App() {
       return (
         <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
           <YourComponent />
         </QueryClientProvider>
       );
     }
     ```

4. **What is the purpose of `useQuery`?**
   - **Answer:** The `useQuery` hook is used to fetch data from a server and manage the state of that data (loading, error, and success states). It handles caching and synchronization of the data.

5. **How do you handle loading and error states in `useQuery`?**
   - **Answer:** You can use the properties `isLoading`, `isError`, and `error` from the result of `useQuery` to handle loading and error states:
     ```jsx
     const { data, isLoading, isError, error } = useQuery(['data'], fetchData);

     if (isLoading) return <div>Loading...</div>;
     if (isError) return <div>Error: {error.message}</div>;
     ```

### Intermediate Questions

6. **What are query keys, and why are they important?**
   - **Answer:** Query keys are unique identifiers for queries. They help React Query to cache, invalidate, and refetch data. They can be strings or arrays, and they ensure that queries with different parameters are treated separately.

7. **How can you refetch data automatically in React Query?**
   - **Answer:** You can configure automatic refetching using options like `refetchInterval`, `refetchOnWindowFocus`, and `refetchOnReconnect` in the `useQuery` hook:
     ```jsx
     useQuery(['data'], fetchData, {
       refetchInterval: 60000, // Refetch every 60 seconds
       refetchOnWindowFocus: true,
     });
     ```

8. **Explain the purpose of `useMutation` and provide a basic example.**
   - **Answer:** The `useMutation` hook is used for creating, updating, or deleting data. It manages the state of these operations (loading, error, and success) and allows for side effects. Example:
     ```jsx
     const mutation = useMutation(createTodo, {
       onSuccess: () => {
         queryClient.invalidateQueries(['todos']);
       },
     });

     const handleAdd = () => {
       mutation.mutate({ title: 'New Todo' });
     };
     ```

9. **What is the `onSuccess` callback in `useMutation`, and how do you use it?**
   - **Answer:** The `onSuccess` callback is a function that is called when the mutation is successful. You can use it to trigger side effects, such as invalidating queries or updating the cache:
     ```jsx
     useMutation(createTodo, {
       onSuccess: () => {
         queryClient.invalidateQueries(['todos']);
       },
     });
     ```

10. **How does React Query handle query caching and invalidation?**
    - **Answer:** React Query caches the results of queries to avoid redundant network requests. Query invalidation can be done using `queryClient.invalidateQueries()`, which forces refetching of data based on the query key.

### Advanced Questions

11. **How do you implement optimistic updates with React Query?**
    - **Answer:** Use the `onMutate` callback in `useMutation` to update the cache optimistically before the mutation completes. Example:
      ```jsx
      const mutation = useMutation(createTodo, {
        onMutate: async (newTodo) => {
          await queryClient.cancelQueries(['todos']);
          const previousTodos = queryClient.getQueryData(['todos']);
          queryClient.setQueryData(['todos'], old => [...old, newTodo]);
          return { previousTodos };
        },
        onError: (err, newTodo, context) => {
          queryClient.setQueryData(['todos'], context.previousTodos);
        },
        onSuccess: () => {
          queryClient.invalidateQueries(['todos']);
        },
      });
      ```

12. **What is the difference between `staleTime` and `cacheTime` in React Query?**
    - **Answer:** `staleTime` is the duration for which the data is considered fresh and won't trigger refetching. `cacheTime` is the duration for which the data remains in the cache before being garbage-collected if no components are using it.

13. **How does React Query handle query cancellation, and why is it useful?**
    - **Answer:** React Query handles query cancellation by using an `AbortController` to abort the fetch request if the component unmounts or the query is invalidated. This prevents unnecessary network requests and helps in avoiding race conditions.

14. **Explain how to use `useInfiniteQuery` for handling infinite scrolling or pagination.**
    - **Answer:** `useInfiniteQuery` handles infinite queries by providing a `fetchNextPage` function and `hasNextPage` boolean. You need to implement `getNextPageParam` to specify how to fetch the next page based on the current data:
      ```jsx
      const {
        data,
        fetchNextPage,
        hasNextPage,
      } = useInfiniteQuery(
        ['todos'],
        fetchTodos,
        {
          getNextPageParam: (lastPage, allPages) => {
            if (lastPage.hasMore) {
              return allPages.length + 1;
            }
            return undefined;
          },
        }
      );
      ```

15. **What are the differences between `useQuery` and `useQueries`?**
    - **Answer:** `useQuery` is used for fetching a single piece of data, while `useQueries` allows you to run multiple queries in parallel. `useQueries` takes an array of query objects and returns an array of results.

### Best Practices

16. **How do you ensure that your queries and mutations are performant and efficient?**
    - **Answer:** Use query keys effectively, manage cache and stale times appropriately, avoid over-fetching by using `staleTime` and `cacheTime`, and leverage pagination and infinite queries for large datasets.

17. **How do you handle authentication and authorization with React Query?**
    - **Answer:** Handle authentication and authorization by configuring headers or credentials in your fetch functions. You can also use React Query’s `context` to pass authentication tokens or user context when making requests.

18. **What are some common pitfalls to avoid when using React Query?**
    - **Answer:** Common pitfalls include:
      - Over-fetching data due to incorrect `staleTime` and `cacheTime` settings.
      - Not handling errors properly, which can lead to a poor user experience.
      - Using improper query keys that lead to cache collisions or incorrect data management.

By preparing answers to these questions and understanding the concepts behind them, you'll be well-equipped for an interview focusing on React Query. If you need further clarification on any of these points, feel free to ask!

Query cancellation is a useful feature in React Query that helps you handle scenarios where a query is no longer needed or should be stopped to avoid unnecessary network requests or processing. This can be particularly important in applications with rapidly changing data or when dealing with multiple concurrent requests.

Here’s a simple example to illustrate how you can use query cancellation with React Query:

### Example: Canceling a Data Fetch Request

Imagine you have a component that fetches user data from an API. You want to cancel the fetch request if the component unmounts before the request completes.

1. **Install React Query** (if not already installed):

   ```bash
   npm install @tanstack/react-query
   ```

2. **Set Up React Query Client**:

   Ensure your application is wrapped with `QueryClientProvider`.

   ```jsx
   import React from 'react';
   import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
   import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from '@tanstack/react-query';
   import App from './App';

   const queryClient = new QueryClient();

   ReactDOM.render(
     <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
       <App />
     </QueryClientProvider>,
     document.getElementById('root')
   );
   ```

3. **Creating the Component with Query Cancellation**:

   Use the `useQuery` hook and handle cancellation by leveraging the `signal` property from the `AbortController`.

   ```jsx
   import React, { useEffect } from 'react';
   import { useQuery } from '@tanstack/react-query';

   const fetchUserData = async (signal) => {
     const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/user', { signal });
     if (!response.ok) {
       throw new Error('Network response was not ok');
     }
     return response.json();
   };

   function UserProfile() {
     // Use the `useQuery` hook with cancellation support
     const { data, error, isLoading } = useQuery(
       ['userData'],
       ({ signal }) => fetchUserData(signal),
       {
         onError: (err) => console.error('Query error:', err),
       }
     );

     if (isLoading) return <div>Loading...</div>;
     if (error) return <div>Error: {error.message}</div>;

     return (
       <div>
         <h1>User Profile</h1>
         <pre>{JSON.stringify(data, null, 2)}</pre>
       </div>
     );
   }

   export default UserProfile;
   ```

### Explanation

1. **AbortController**: 
   - The `AbortController` is used to create an `AbortSignal` which is passed to the fetch request. When the `abort()` method is called on the `AbortController`, it triggers the fetch request to be canceled.

2. **Cancellation Handling**:
   - In the `fetchUserData` function, the `signal` is included in the fetch request options. If the component unmounts or the query is invalidated, React Query will automatically call the `abort()` method on the `AbortController`, canceling the fetch request.

3. **Query Hook**:
   - The `useQuery` hook accepts an options object where you can pass a query function that receives the `signal`. This allows you to manage the fetch request lifecycle and handle cancellations appropriately.

### Additional Notes

- React Query automatically handles cancellation for queries when the component using the query unmounts, but it's good to explicitly manage cancellations when working with custom query functions or long-running requests.
- If you use `useQuery` with multiple concurrent requests or pagination, React Query manages the cancellations and refetching for you, but understanding the manual cancellation can help with more complex use cases.

This setup helps ensure that your application does not perform unnecessary work and provides a smoother user experience by avoiding potential issues with incomplete or outdated data.


Certainly! Here are more advanced and nuanced interview questions related to React Query, covering deeper aspects of its usage, integration with other libraries, and complex scenarios:

### Advanced Questions

19. **How can you perform dependent queries using React Query?**
    - **Answer:** Dependent queries are queries that rely on the results of other queries. You can use the `enabled` option in `useQuery` to conditionally fetch data based on the results of another query:
      ```jsx
      function DependentQueryComponent() {
        const { data: userId } = useQuery(['userId'], fetchUserId);
        const { data: userData, isLoading, error } = useQuery(
          ['user', userId],
          () => fetchUserData(userId),
          { enabled: !!userId } // Only fetch when userId is available
        );

        if (isLoading) return <div>Loading...</div>;
        if (error) return <div>Error: {error.message}</div>;

        return <div>User Data: {JSON.stringify(userData)}</div>;
      }
      ```

20. **How can you handle cache invalidation across multiple queries?**
    - **Answer:** Use `queryClient.invalidateQueries` to invalidate multiple queries by providing an array of query keys or a function to match queries:
      ```jsx
      queryClient.invalidateQueries(['todos']);
      queryClient.invalidateQueries({
        predicate: query => query.queryKey[0] === 'someCondition'
      });
      ```

21. **What are the benefits and drawbacks of using `useQuery` versus `useInfiniteQuery`?**
    - **Answer:** 
      - `useQuery` is ideal for fetching a single, static dataset. It’s straightforward and manages simple data fetching needs effectively.
      - `useInfiniteQuery` is designed for paginated data or infinite scrolling, allowing you to fetch and concatenate multiple pages of data. It handles the complexity of pagination internally but requires additional configuration.

22. **Explain how you would implement a global state with React Query and local state with React’s `useState` in a component.**
    - **Answer:** Combine React Query for server state with React’s local state for component-specific state. Use React Query for managing data fetched from the server and local state for UI-specific state:
      ```jsx
      function MyComponent() {
        const [localState, setLocalState] = useState('initialValue');
        const { data, isLoading, error } = useQuery(['data'], fetchData);

        if (isLoading) return <div>Loading...</div>;
        if (error) return <div>Error: {error.message}</div>;

        return (
          <div>
            <button onClick={() => setLocalState('newValue')}>Update Local State</button>
            <p>Local State: {localState}</p>
            <p>Server Data: {JSON.stringify(data)}</p>
          </div>
        );
      }
      ```

23. **How would you handle error recovery and retry strategies in React Query?**
    - **Answer:** React Query provides `retry` and `retryDelay` options for handling retries:
      ```jsx
      useQuery(['data'], fetchData, {
        retry: 3, // Retry up to 3 times
        retryDelay: attempt => Math.min(1000 * 2 ** attempt, 30000) // Exponential backoff
      });
      ```

24. **Describe how you can integrate React Query with a GraphQL client like Apollo.**
    - **Answer:** React Query and Apollo can be used together by managing different parts of your data fetching needs. React Query can handle RESTful queries and mutations, while Apollo manages GraphQL queries. Ensure they are well-coordinated to avoid conflicts and optimize performance:
      ```jsx
      import { ApolloClient, InMemoryCache } from '@apollo/client';
      import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from '@tanstack/react-query';
      
      const apolloClient = new ApolloClient({
        uri: 'https://graphql.example.com',
        cache: new InMemoryCache(),
      });

      const queryClient = new QueryClient();

      function App() {
        return (
          <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
            {/* Your React Query components */}
          </QueryClientProvider>
        );
      }
      ```

25. **How do you handle pagination with server-side rendering (SSR) in Next.js using React Query?**
    - **Answer:** Use `getServerSideProps` or `getStaticProps` in Next.js to fetch initial data server-side, and then use React Query for client-side fetching and pagination:
      ```jsx
      export async function getServerSideProps(context) {
        const res = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/data?page=1`);
        const data = await res.json();
        return { props: { initialData: data } };
      }

      function PaginatedComponent({ initialData }) {
        const { data, fetchNextPage, hasNextPage } = useInfiniteQuery(
          ['data'],
          fetchPaginatedData,
          {
            initialData: { pages: [initialData], pageParams: [1] }
          }
        );

        return (
          <div>
            <ul>
              {data.pages.flat().map(item => (
                <li key={item.id}>{item.title}</li>
              ))}
            </ul>
            <button onClick={() => fetchNextPage()} disabled={!hasNextPage}>
              Load More
            </button>
          </div>
        );
      }
      ```

26. **What is query context in React Query, and how can you use it?**
    - **Answer:** Query context is used to provide additional context or configuration for queries. You can use the `context` option in `useMutation` to pass context that can be used in callbacks like `onMutate`, `onError`, and `onSuccess`:
      ```jsx
      const mutation = useMutation(mutateData, {
        onMutate: (variables) => {
          const context = { previousData: queryClient.getQueryData(['data']) };
          // Use context in mutation callbacks
          return context;
        },
      });
      ```

27. **How does React Query handle concurrent queries, and how can you optimize their performance?**
    - **Answer:** React Query handles concurrent queries by batching them and managing their lifecycle independently. Optimize performance by using query keys to differentiate queries, using `staleTime` to reduce unnecessary refetching, and avoiding over-fetching with pagination or filters.

28. **What are the differences between `useQuery` and `useQueries`?**
    - **Answer:** `useQuery` is used for a single query, while `useQueries` allows multiple queries to be run simultaneously. `useQueries` takes an array of query objects and returns an array of results, which is useful for handling multiple data sources or requests in parallel.

29. **Explain how to use React Query with WebSockets or real-time updates.**
    - **Answer:** Integrate WebSockets by manually updating React Query’s cache when receiving new data through WebSockets:
      ```jsx
      useEffect(() => {
        const socket = new WebSocket('wss://example.com/socket');

        socket.onmessage = (event) => {
          const newData = JSON.parse(event.data);
          queryClient.setQueryData(['data'], oldData => [...oldData, newData]);
        };

        return () => socket.close();
      }, [queryClient]);
      ```

30. **Discuss how you would manage query dependencies and ensure that dependent queries are handled correctly.**
    - **Answer:** Use the `enabled` option in `useQuery` to control when queries are fetched based on dependencies. For more complex scenarios, use `useQuery` with `onSuccess` or `onSettled` callbacks to trigger dependent queries programmatically:
      ```jsx
      const { data: userId } = useQuery(['userId'], fetchUserId);
      const { data: userData, isLoading } = useQuery(
        ['user', userId],
        () => fetchUserData(userId),
        { enabled: !!userId }
      );
      ```
