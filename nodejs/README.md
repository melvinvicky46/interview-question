**RESTful API**

```
A RESTful API (also known as REST API) is an application programming interface (API) that conforms to the REST architectural style and allows interaction with RESTful web services. REST stands for Representational State Transfer. RESTful APIs are commonly used in web and mobile applications to retrieve or modify resources and data on remote systems.
