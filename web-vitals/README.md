Core Web Vitals are a set of specific factors that Google considers important in determining the overall user experience provided by a web page. They are part of Google's larger effort to emphasize user experience as a key ranking factor for websites. There are three core web vitals metrics:

1. **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP):**
   - **Definition:** LCP measures how quickly the largest content element (such as an image or a block of text) within the viewport becomes visible to the user.
   - **Ideal Benchmark:** To provide a good user experience, LCP should occur within 2.5 seconds of when the page first starts loading.
   - **Example:** Suppose you have a news website where the main headline and image are the largest content elements. LCP would measure how long it takes for that headline and image to fully load and become visible to the user.

2. **First Input Delay (FID):**
   - **Definition:** FID measures the time from when a user first interacts with a page (such as clicking a link or button) to the time when the browser is actually able to respond to that interaction.
   - **Ideal Benchmark:** To provide a good user experience, pages should have an FID of less than 100 milliseconds.
   - **Example:** On an e-commerce site, FID would measure the delay between a user clicking "Add to Cart" and the browser responding by adding the item to the cart.

3. **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS):**
   - **Definition:** CLS measures the sum total of all individual layout shift scores that occur during the entire lifespan of the page. A layout shift happens when visible elements on the page unexpectedly move from their initial position.
   - **Ideal Benchmark:** To provide a good user experience, pages should maintain a CLS of less than 0.1.
   - **Example:** On a content-rich website, if an ad suddenly loads and shifts the text downwards just as the user is about to click a link, it would contribute to a poor CLS score.

### Importance and Impact

These metrics are crucial because they directly impact how users perceive and interact with your website. Pages that perform well on Core Web Vitals are likely to have lower bounce rates, higher engagement, and potentially better search engine rankings. 

To improve Core Web Vitals:
- Optimize images and videos to reduce LCP.
- Minimize and defer JavaScript to improve FID.
- Specify dimensions for media and ads to prevent CLS.

By focusing on these metrics, web developers and SEO professionals can enhance user experience, which ultimately leads to better performance in search results and happier users.
