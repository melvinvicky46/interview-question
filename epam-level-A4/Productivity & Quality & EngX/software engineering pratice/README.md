**Skill Description**
Software engineering practices are concerned with developing and maintaining software systems that behave reliably and efficiently, are affordable to develop and maintain, and satisfy all the requirements that customers have defined for them. 

This is collection of practices of Code Quality, CI/CD, practices working with VCS, Testing Fudamentals, best approaches and methods in Automated and Performance Testing, all that a software engineer uses on a daily basis. They equip software engineers to efficiently build computer programs and provide necessary technical "how to" getting the job done. The software engineering practices cover core developer activities required for producing of high quality code and thus solutions.

**What you should know A4**
Ability to :

establish required Code Quality Practices in given context (project/stream)
design CI/CD process, analyse it for bottlenecks 
implement CI/CD pipelines
establish required test automation according to the context
choose appropriate VCS and bracnhing strategy
use advanced features of distributed VCS (Git): hooks, tags, pruning local and remote etc
conduct performance testing according to performance testing objectives
organize corresponding knowledge sharing.

**What you should know A2**
Understanding of purpose, benefits and drawbacks of Code Quality (Code Review, Static/Dynamic Code Analysis, etc).

Ability to implement simple CI/CD related tasks.

Knowledge of :

main concepts working with VCS (distributed: pull/merge-request, rebasing, stashing, forking etc)
some branching strategies (GitFlow, Github etc) 
Ability to create tests on different levels of Test Pyramid.

Understanding of some types of Performance Testing (Load, Stress, etc).

Ability to identify gaps and propose improvements in implementation of different practices.
