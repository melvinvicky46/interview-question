**Skill Description**
Software design is the process to transform the user requirements into software artifact (solution/product) intended to accomplish goals. Software design usually involves problem-solving and planning a software solution. This includes design of low-level components and algorithms using different well-known design paterns, and a high-level or architecture design via application of Architectural patterns, adherence to Design Principles, understanding of Programming Paradigms, ability to work with Technical Documentation (from reading to creation) and understanding and proper implementation of main Cross-Cutting Concerns (logging, error handling and secure coding)

**What you should know**
**In  particular context ability to decide on applicability of different:**

architectural patterns(n-Tier, SOA, event-driven architecture, microservices, etc) 
design patterns (GoF, Dependency Injection/IoC) 
design principles (Clean Code principles, SOLID, high cohesion & low coupling)
Ability to compare main programming paradigm (OOP, FP, RP), their pros/cons

Ability to create technical documentation (coding standards, software engineering diagram)

Ability to select proper approach (patterns, 3rd party libs/frameworks) for implementaion of Cross-Cutting Concerns for the whole solution and/or its significant part
