**Skill Description**
Common security knowledge refers to the general understanding of principles and techniques that allow people to keep applications, websites, and associated data sources secure. This includes topics like web application architecture, authentication and authorization mechanisms, common attack vectors, input validation and output encoding best practices, cryptography basics, client-side security considerations such as cross-site scripting (XSS) and cross-site request forgery (CSRF), server-side security considerations such as SQL injection and directory traversal attacks, server hardening guidelines, secure transport protocols like HTTPS/TLS certification options, vulnerability scanning methods, security scanners,  secure coding practices, logging and incident response procedures.

**What you should know A4**
OWASP top 10 list knowledge, ability to classify and remediate vulnerabilities.

Security code review experience.

Proficiency in client-side and server-side security hardening, and implementing guidelines.

Knowledge of vulnerability scanning methods and security scanning tools.

Incident response process basics.

Shift left security principle, secure coding practices and S-SDLC best practices knowledge.

Understanding of cryptography basics (e.g. symmetric and asymmetric encryption, hashing functions, ciphers, salt, digital signatures).

**What you should know A3**
Strong understanding and experience with authentication and authorization mechanisms (basic, JWT, OAuth, etc).

Ability to identify common attack vectors (XSS, CSRF, SSRF, injection, log ingestion, directory traversal, etc.) and implement compensating strategy.

Awareness of secure application architectural components.

Familiarity with secure transport protocols like HTTPS/TLS.

Basic secure coding practices knowledge.

Hashing and cryptography basics (e.g. symmetric and asymmetric encryption).

**What you should know A2**
Basic attack vectors awareness (like XSS, SSRF, CSRF, injections).

Basic understanding of application security mechanisms including security controls and countermeasures.
