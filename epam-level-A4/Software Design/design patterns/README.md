**Skill Description**
Design patterns are a set of commonly used, reusable solutions to problems encountered when developing software. They are typically related to object-oriented programming and provide guidance on how to write reliable and maintainable code. Design patterns help programmers to quickly identify the most appropriate solution for their project when implementing software designs. Additionally, they help improve code readability, reliability, and scalability. Examples of design patterns include Model-View-Controller (MVC), Factory Pattern, Observer Pattern, Dependency Injection Pattern, Strategy Pattern, State Pattern and others.
